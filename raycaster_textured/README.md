# simple raycaster implementation with sdl

textured
heavily inspired by [lode's raycasting tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

## todo

- crashed while walking
- get stuck inside wall, wall collision error
- check for hardcoded textures and stuff, last time i tried to run it on a different computer it failed to start
