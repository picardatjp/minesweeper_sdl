# logic gate simulation in sdl
##todo
- make tree of gates, seeing which ones to update when a signal is changed
- add text onto gate
- add i/o ports to gates
- add lines/connections between gate input/outputs
- make it so you can move gates around
- maybe add grid system for lines and gates to snap to
- maybe add scrolling and zooming in/out of grid
- add integrated circuit from previously made logic circuits
