add texture to button
check if user clicked button and released over it, not just released.
add ttf stuff to textbox and button classes
redo text input, pressing multiple keys at once repeats keys. maybe else if on first key found, not all keys
    and make shifts and ctrls flags
implement cursor in textbox
figure out a way to open files, preferably without windows.h.
    maybe create new popup window that just lists all items in a directory, button to go up and down directories, each item is a button.
    if button is folder cd into it, if file copy path.
scroll textbox
create drop down box like in the win32 api menu
